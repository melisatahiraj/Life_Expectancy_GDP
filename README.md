## Overview

#### Life Expectancy Over Time

- Every country demonstrates a consistent overall increase in trends without any notable declines over time
- Zimbabwe stands out as the country with the most significant improvement in Life Expectancy

#### GDP Over Time

- Every country has experienced continual growth in its GDP over time
- China and the United States of America have recorded the most significant upswing in GDP over the years

#### Life Expectancy & GDP Correlation

- There is a strong positive correlation between Life Expectancy and GDP in all countries
- Thus, a rise in Life Expectancy is associated with an increase in GDP, and conversely, a decrease in Life Expectancy is linked to a decrease in GDP or vice versa

#### The Average Life Expectancy

- Five out of six countries exhibit an average Life Expectancy ranging approximately from 74 to 80 years, except Zimbabwe
- The average Life Expectancy in Zimbabwe is around 50 years, demonstrating a substantial deviation from the other countries which demands further analysis

#### Distribution of Life Expectancy

- Among the six countries, five display a uniform distribution with minimal data variability, pointing to specific conditions influencing Life Expectancy
- In contrast, Zimbabwe stands out as the only country exhibiting a wide range in data distribution and a median lower than all the other countries, suggesting there are distinct conditions affecting Zimbabweâ€™s Life Expectancy compared to the rest of the countries
